VGDB .NET MVC Project
=====================

Author: John Haynes
Title: Application Developer

This project is being developed as a side project in order to learn more about .NET and the MVC framework. Seeing as I have a passion for video games, I decided that this project would help me to learn more about the technologies that I have been hired to work with. I have a passion for learning new technologies and have decided to merge that passion with something else that I love, video games!

As this is my first foray into GitHub and Git, I have decided to upload this project in order to learn more about the features of GitHub and how it helps with collaboration. Thank you for taking time to read this and I look forward to sharing my project with anyone who is interested!

Thanks,
John Haynes
